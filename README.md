Maybe you'll drive a little less!

## Instructions for testing


First, `cd` into `backend` and run: 
```
npm i
npm start
```
This installs the proper packages starts the backend server

Then, `cd` into `frontend` and run:
```
npm i
npm start
```
This installs the proper packages, starts the front end code server, and automatically opens up a browser

Sign in and hope it doesn't break :D
