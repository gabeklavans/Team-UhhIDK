We chose the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack for this project.

This stack simply seems to be the most popular choice right now; because of this, it's well documented and we found many resources to help us implement it. 

Node.js allows us to code in JavaScript on the backend which allows for more fluid and less-ambiguous communication between front and back end devs. It also makes data exchange more analagous.

Express simplifies setting up the server and routing around the REST api calls.

Angular is among the three most popular front-end libaries and I (Gabe) just like Google's style. We ended up just using HTML and JavaScript for the front end, instead of Angular, because we realized that Angular is quite complicated and outside of the scope of this project because the app is only one page.

MongoDB is an easy to use non-relational data base that offers a simple cloud-based solution (MongoDB Atlas). Mongo is easy to use with Node/Express and even though there is a tradeoff between simplicity and performance with Mongo, we decided to prioritize simplicity because the database is small and we did not expect any performance issues.
