As a logged-in user, I want to connect with others on the app and to be able to show others my achievements on the app.  Each user on the app will have a friends list consisting of other users.  The user can add someone to his/her friends list by searching a name or a username in the search bar.  If any users with matching names or usernames exist, their profiles will appear in the search results.  Each profile will have an “Add friend” button next to it that the user can click.  If no matches exist, then a message such as “No results found” will be displayed.  Additionally, the user might be able to add friends through their contacts or through social media.  In this case, the app would feature a list of the user’s contacts or connections on other social media.  Each contact/connection would have an “Add friend” button next to it that the user can click.  When a user is added as a friend by someone else, the user will see a friend request with buttons to either accept or decline the request.  The app will also calculate stats for each user based on that user’s total points and achievements.  Each user’s stats will be displayed on their own profile, and each user will be able to view their friends’ stats by clicking on their friends’ profiles.
