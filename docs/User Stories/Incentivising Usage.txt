As a logged-in user, I want some kind of reward system to motivate me to be more sustainable.  If a user changes a habit in order to be more sustainable (for example, choosing to walk to work instead of driving) and logs this change as part of their input data, the app will calculate the amount by which this change reduces their environmental footprint and give the user a specific number of points based on that amount.  For each milestone that the user reaches (for example, for every 100 points that they reach), the app will display a message to the user, congratulating them on this milestone and thanking them for their efforts to be sustainable.  Additionally, for each achievement that the user makes (for example, for each 20 pounds of carbon dioxide that the user saves from being released by walking instead of driving), the app will display a similar message, congratulating them on this achievement and thanking them for their efforts.  Furthermore, the user will be able to view their total points and achievements on a tab in the app.
