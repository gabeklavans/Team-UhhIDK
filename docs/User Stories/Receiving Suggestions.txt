The logged-in user (refer to Logging In) has been using the app for a period of time, and, as advertised, wants to receive suggestions for how to reduce their carbon footprint. There are two main ways the user can receive suggestions, passive and active. 
Passive suggestions are those shown to the user without prompt from the user. On the homepage of the app (the first page seen after logging in), there will be a prominent section where passive suggestions will be displayed. These will be tailored to the user based on their logged usage data, and will be algorithmically generated. If there is an insufficient amount of data, this will be displayed in message form in this section. If multiple suggestions can be made to the user, the algorithm will determine the one or two most prominent suggestions to display, so as not to overwhelm the user. Prominence may be based on a couple of factors, such as ease of implementation, cause, and effectiveness. If the algorithm has enough data but cannot determine a suggestion, then this section will simply display a positive message telling the user to keep up the good work.
Active suggestions are more detailed and more verbose. They will be housed in a separate tab that the user can navigate to. All suggestions that the algorithm can generate for the specific user will be housed and displayed here, with dropdown tabs containing information to improve the userâ€™s carbon footprint in the suggested area. The user will be able to filter what is displayed through different parameters (cause, level of difficulty, etc.). Some of these suggestions may contain links to external resources that will provide even more information. Any invalid parameters set by the user will display an error. Similar to the passive suggestion section, if there are no suggestions to be displayed, it will just give the user a positive message and direct them to the non-personal arbitrary suggestion/directory section of the app (refer to Arbitrary Suggestions).
