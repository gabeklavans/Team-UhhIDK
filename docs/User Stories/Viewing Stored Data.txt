The logged-in user (refer to Logging In) has been using the app for a period of time and has been logging data, such as the food they ate and the methods of transportation they took. Now, they want to see some sort of visual representation of their carbon footprint based on the data they logged. 
The user will click on a specific button/tab that will bring them to a page displaying a graph of their carbon footprint over time, likely a line graph. Here there will be options for how to fine-tune the graph for their specific viewing needs, such as specifying a time frame, separating the data points by type of emission (food, transportation, etc.) using colors. Additionally, there will be buttons for exporting the data to some other form for use in other applications. If there is no data logged, then the tab will simply report that there is no data yet, so nothing can be displayed. If the user attempts to specify a parameter in one of the filters that is invalid, such as an impossible date range, it will show an alert that the parameter is invalid and specify which parameter is invalid.
