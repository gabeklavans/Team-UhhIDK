Happy path for logging in user story:

- User goes onto the website
- Enter username and password
- entering the correct username and password will navigate you to your dashboard

Things that can go wrong:

Authorization failed: 
- this means you entered your credentials wrong
- Error will show on screen
- Click “Forgot Password” button and go through steps to change it
- After changing your password, begin log in process again. 

- Failed authorization could also mean you do not have an account, so you can click “Create Account” button
